There lived a man named George. George was a nice man, who loved long walks on the beach and pancakes. George was a great guy all around. George was from Georgia and was sitting at his favorite restaurant eating 40 pancakes.  

While enjoying his pancakes, a women asked if she could sit with him. Although he did not know why she had requested this, George still allowed her to sit, as she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.

George didn't know what to do except awkwardly stare at her, mouth open, until the waiter came and snapped him back to reality. "Would you like some more pancakes sir? You seem to have finished them all!" George looked at the watier but before he could responed, the women accross from him chimed in. "Yes he would love 100 more!".

Wow, George never knew that there was anyone that loved pancakes just as much as he did. George and the gal began to talk and talk until finally 5 waiters came to deliver all of the pancakes! Just the sight of the pancakes next to this woman made George excited. The woman pulled out a mysterious can out of her purse, she said it was boysenberry syrup. This was the best thing George had ever tasted.

This was just the beginning of their relationship but George and this woman would go on to live happily ever after together. The two of them together would change the world - by opening the world's first IHOP.
